# What’d we learn
- We can use the v-model directive to create two-way binding on form elements
- We can use the .number modifier to tell Vue to cast that value as a number, but there is a bug with it
- We can use the .prevent event modifier to stop the page from reloading when the form is submitted
- We can use Vue to do fairly simple custom form validation

# Learn by doing
## Challenge
Add a question to the form: “Would you recommend this product”. Then take in that response from the user via radio buttons of “yes” or “no” and add it to the productReview object, with form validation.
