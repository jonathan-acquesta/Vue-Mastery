# Whatâ€™d we learn
- The v-for directive allows us to iterate over an array to display data.
- We use an alias for the element in the array being iterated on, and specify the name of the array we are looping through. Ex: v-for="item in items"
- We can loop over an array of objects and use dot notation to display values from the objects.
- When using v-for it is recommended to give each rendered element its own unique key.
