# So what have we learned?
- Data can be bound to HTML attributes.
- Syntax is v-bind: or : for short.
- The attribute name that comes after the : specifies the attribute we’re binding data to.
- Inside the attribute’s quotes, we reference the data we’re binding to.

# Learn by doing
## Challenge:
Add a link to your data object, and use v-bind to sync it up with an anchor tag in your HTML. Hint: you’ll be binding to the href attribute.
